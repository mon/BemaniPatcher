    <h1>Initial D Arcade Stage Zero DLL Modder</h1>
    <center style="color: rgb(189, 29, 29)"><b>WARNING: This is version 2 of the fullscreen patch, but it needs more testing.</b></center>
      <center>
      Pro tip: Using the fullscreen patch and using Rivatuner to lock to 60fps, then setting "FullScreen = 0" and "SYNCMODE = 0" in the InitialD.ini<br />will let you alt-tab out
      of the game, and still run at locked 60fps.

    <center style="color: rgb(212, 66, 146)"><b>Notes about the in-store patch:</b></center>
    <center>
      The game will still require an ip in the 192.168.X.X range to boot up. However, everything past that can be freely choosen now, so using something like zerotier or a custom
      vpn It's technically possible to play in-store battles. You'll need to both have matching ip-ranges in segatools.ini though, and one of you'll have to disable dipsw1, etc.
